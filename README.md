# Code Refactor Starter Code
Assignment to carefully, change html tags as well as alt descriptions

## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to test the understanding of the semantics located within an HTML file. As per assignment, all HTML div tags were changed to their appropriate semantic tags. Including, main, aside, article, section, footer, and header. Comments have been added to explain all HTML and CSS changes. 
In addition, comments have been added to explain the reasoning behind these changes in both the HTML file and the CSS file. Finally all images within the code now have an alt, giving a brief description of the image.
